== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do i use this plugin? =

Once installed and activated, the plugin adds an additional meta box for WordPress pages. You simply need to navigate to any page (or create a new one) and you will be able to see the new meta box on the right side. The default outline, like it is in Gantry 5 is the Base Outline. You can quickly assign the page to another outline without having to go to the Gantry 5 theme options.

= Outlines do not exist =

Please check you are using a Gantry 5 powered theme. If so, the meta box will show, otherwise it won't.

= No Outlines found =

Gantry 5 comes with the Base Outline by default, so it should show at least the Base Outline. If not, please contact us for support.
