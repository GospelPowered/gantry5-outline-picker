The Page Outline Assignment plugin allows you to choose your desired Gantry 5 outline when creating pages, saving you time!

== Description ==

The Page Outline Assignment plugin saves you time when creating pages using Gantry 5 enabled themes. Traditionally you would have to create a page, then go into Gantry outlines, then into Assignments and select the page you just created. 

With this plugin, you will have one click ability to assign new or existing pages to Gantry 5 Outlines!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. No extra configuration is required, visit any page and you will be able to see the added meta box on the right side

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do i use this plugin? =

Once installed and activated, the plugin adds an additional meta box for WordPress pages. You simply need to navigate to any page (or create a new one) and you will be able to see the new meta box on the right side. The default outline, like it is in Gantry 5 is the Base Outline. You can quickly assign the page to another outline without having to go to the Gantry 5 theme options.

= Outlines do not exist =

Please check you are using a Gantry 5 powered theme. If so, the meta box will show, otherwise it won't.

= No Outlines found =

Gantry 5 comes with the Base Outline by default, so it should show at least the Base Outline. If not, please contact us for support.
